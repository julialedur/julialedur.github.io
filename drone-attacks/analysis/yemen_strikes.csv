The New York Times reports that Usayd al-Adnani, whom Pentagon spokesman CAPT Jeff Davis referred to as the ""longtime explosives expert who served as the organizationâ€™s emirâ€ in Yemen's Abyan province, died in a March 2 strike along with Yasir Ali Abdallah al Silmi, also known as Abi al-Muhajir al-Ibbi and Mohammed Tahar and was a former GuantÃ¡namo Bay prisoner. Because of al-Adnani's status as the emir of AQAP in Abyan, we are listing his and al Silmi's deaths with this strike, the only one occurring in Abyan on March 2. An account from AFP reports that the strike also targeted Qassem Khalil who died on Thursday, March 10, though it is unclear what his role with AQAP was.","AQAP","13.671659","45.8190862",,"Drone Strike",,,"1045","<li>Reuters: <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-yemen-idUSKBN1691PV"" target=""_blank"">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-yemen-idUSKBN1691PV</a></li>\n <li>TimesNow: <a href=""http://www.timesnow.tv/international/article/us-drone-strike-kills-12-al-qaeda-members-killed-in-yemen/56964"" target=""_blank"">http://www.timesnow.tv/international/article/us-drone-strike-kills-12-al-qaeda-members-killed-in-yemen/56964</a></li>\n <li>Qatar Tribune/AFP: <a href=""http://www.qatar-tribune.com/news-details/id/51573"" target=""_blank"">http://www.qatar-tribune.com/news-details/id/51573</a></li>\n <li>New York Times: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/world/middleeast/yemen-airstrikes-qaeda.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/world/middleeast/yemen-airstrikes-qaeda.html?_r=0</a></li>\n <li>Guardian/AFP: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/06/former-guantanamo-bay-inmate-killed-us-air-strike-yemen"" target=""_blank"">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/06/former-guantanamo-bay-inmate-killed-us-air-strike-yemen</a></li>\n <li>Daily Star/AFP: <a href=""https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2017/Mar-09/396776-suspected-al-qaeda-militant-killed-in-yemen-drone-strike.ashx"" target=""_blank"">https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2017/Mar-09/396776-suspected-al-qaeda-militant-killed-in-yemen-drone-strike.ashx</a></li>","Reuters"," http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-yemen-idUSKBN1691PV target=_blank","\n TimesNow"," http://www.timesnow.tv/international/article/us-drone-strike-kills-12-al-qaeda-members-killed-in-yemen/56964 target=_blank","\n Qatar Tribune/AFP"," http://www.qatar-tribune.com/news-details/id/51573 target=_blank","\n New York Times"," https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/world/middleeast/yemen-airstrikes-qaeda.html?_r=0 target=_blank","\n Guardian/AFP"," https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/06/former-guantanamo-bay-inmate-killed-us-air-strike-yemen target=_blank","\n Daily Star/AFP"," https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2017/Mar-09/396776-suspected-al-qaeda-militant-killed-in-yemen-drone-strike.ashx target=_blank",,,"<a href=' http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-yemen-idUSKBN1691PV target=_blank'>Reuters</a>, <a href=' http://www.timesnow.tv/international/article/us-drone-strike-kills-12-al-qaeda-members-killed-in-yemen/56964 target=_blank'>\n TimesNow</a>, <a href=' http://www.qatar-tribune.com/news-details/id/51573 target=_blank'>\n Qatar Tribune/AFP</a>, <a href=' https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/world/middleeast/yemen-airstrikes-qaeda.html?_r=0 target=_blank'>\n New York Times</a>, <a href=' https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/06/former-guantanamo-bay-inmate-killed-us-air-strike-yemen target=_blank'>\n Guardian/AFP</a>, <a href=' https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2017/Mar-09/396776-suspected-al-qaeda-militant-killed-in-yemen-drone-strike.ashx target=_blank'>\n Daily Star/AFP</a>","5",,,"5"

Trump, was conducted in the Yakla district of Yemen's al-Bayda province on the morning of Sunday, January 29, 2017. According to CBS and other news outlets, the Navy's SEAL Team 6 carried out the attack that killed between 13 and 14 AQAP militants -- including potential female combatants, according to the Pentagon. Reports also claim that three AQAP leaders were killed. (AQAP has confirmed the death of Abdul-Raouf al-Dhahab.) The operation officially began Saturday evening around 9:00pm with, according to CBS, U.S. warplanes firing 16 missiles at three houses. U.S.-operated drones were also reportedly used. In addition to the AQAP militants, Yemeni officials say as many as 16 civilians -- including women and children -- were killed. This allegedly includes the eight-year-old daughter of deceased American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed by a U.S. drone in Yemen in 2011. U.S. Central Command confirmed on March 9, 2017 that the operation caused between four and 12 casualties. A SEAL Team 6 operator, Chief Special Warfare Operator William ""Ryan"" Owens (USN), was killed during the operation. Three additional SEAL team members were wounded.","AQAP","14.3009714","44.7539473",,"Ground Operation",,,"1040","<li>CBS: <a

The Yemeni Embassy in Washington D.C. released a statement on December 24, 2009 saying, "" ""Today, Yemeni fighter jets launched an aerial assault at 4:30 a.m., on a remote location in the province of Shabwa."" Other reports indicated that the strike was actually carried out by a U.S. cruise missile. The United States said it only provided intelligence, while Yemen denied involvement altogether. A diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks appears to indicate that it was indeed a U.S. strike, but it remains unclear what form the attack took.</p>","503","<p> ABC: http://abcnews.go.com/WN/abcs-pierre-thomas-reports-latest-raid-yemen-killed/story?id=9419756#.T7qQJO3-DHh; Guardian: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/24/yemen-strike-al-qaida; NYT: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/world/middleeast/25yemen.html; Reuters: http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/12/24/idINIndia-44972820091224?sp=true</p>"," ABC"," http://abcnews.go.com/WN/abcs-pierre-thomas-reports-latest-raid-yemen-killed/story?id=9419756#.T7qQJO3-DHh","Guardian"," http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/24/yemen-strike-al-qaida","NYT"," http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/world/middleeast/25yemen.html","Reuters"," http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/12/24/idINIndia-44972820091224?sp=true",,,,,,,"<a href=' http://abcnews.go.com/WN/abcs-pierre-thomas-reports-latest-raid-yemen-killed/story?id=9419756#.T7qQJO3-DHh'> ABC</a>, <a href=' http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/24/yemen-strike-al-qaida'>Guardian</a>, <a href=' http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/world/middleeast/25yemen.html'>NYT</a>, <a href=' http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/12/24/idINIndia-44972820091224?sp=true'>Reuters</a>","30",,,"30"
